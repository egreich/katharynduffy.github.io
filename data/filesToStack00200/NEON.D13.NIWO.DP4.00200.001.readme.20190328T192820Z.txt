DATA PRODUCT INFORMATION
------------------------

ID: NEON.DOM.SITE.DP4.00200.001

Name: Bundled data products - eddy covariance

Description: Bundle of eddy-covariance data products, including related meteorological and soil data products.

NEON Science Team Supplier: TIS

Abstract: Net surface-atmosphere exchange, or “flux” quantifies how much heat, H2O and CO2 are transferred between an ecosystem and the atmosphere. Fluxes are useful in a variety scientific applications, including to study ecosystem processes, to interpret and calibrate satellite observations of the earth system, and to constrain ecosystem and earth system models. One of the most direct approaches to observe the net surface-atmosphere exchange is the in-situ [eddy-covariance method](https://youtu.be/CR4Anc8Mkas). Calculation of the net surface-atmosphere exchange involves the estimation of at least two major terms (assuming horizontally homogenous surface conditions): the turbulent flux and the storage flux. In addition, stable isotope measurements of CO2 and H2O within and above the ecosystem canopy can support the subsequent partitioning of the net surface-atmosphere exchange into ecosystem constituent fluxes. For example, partitioning CO2 into photosynthesis and respiration, or evaporation and transpiration in the case of H2O.

Brief Design Description: All terrestrial NEON sites are equipped with a tower and sensors that collect turbulent flux measurements at the tower top. The CSAT-3 sonic anemometer (Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, Utah, USA) records 3-dimensional wind speed and wind direction data at 20 Hz. The attitude and motion reference system (AMRS, Xsens North America Inc., model MTI-300-2A5G4; Culver City, California, USA) tracks the motion of the CSAT-3 sonic anemometer and records pitch, roll and yaw data at 40 Hz. The LI-7200 gas analyzer (Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) records CO2 and H2O concentration at 20 Hz. These dp00 raw data are used to generate 1-min and 30-min dp01 descriptive statistics data products, as well as 30-min dp04 turbulent flux data products.

The storage flux system consists of a suite of sensors that record temperature, CO2 and H2O along the tower vertical profile. The air temperature profile is measured at 1 Hz with aspirated temperature sensors (MetOne Instruments, Inc., model 076B-7388; Grant Pass, Oregon, USA). In addition, air samples from all vertical measurement levels on the tower are drawn and delivered to a gas analyzer (Li-Cor, Inc., model LI-840A; Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) in the instrument hut for analysis. The LI840A gas analyzer records the CO2 and H2O concentration at 1 Hz. These data are used to generate 2-min and 30-min dp01 descriptive statistics data products, which are used to further produce 30-min dp02 temporally interpolated data products, dp03 spatially interpolated data products, and derived dp04 storage flux data products.

Sensors for stable isotopic measurements are located inside the instrument hut. Air samples along the tower vertical profile are drawn and delivered to the sensors for analysis. The PICARRO G2131-i CO2 isotopic analyzer records the CO2 concentration and delta 13C at ~1 Hz; the PICARRO L2130-i H2O isotopic analyzer records the H2O concentration and delta 18O and 2H at ~1 Hz. These data are used to generate 9-min and 30-min dp01 descriptive statistics data products.

For command, control and configuration details please see [NEON.DOC.000456](http://data.neonscience.org/documents).

Brief Study Area Description: Data are collected at all terrestrial sites, along the vertical tower profile from the ground to the tower top above the canopy. These data are used to determine the net ecosystem exchange of heat and gases (CO2, H2O, etc.) between the atmosphere and the ecosystem of interest.

ADDITIONAL REMARKS
------------------

NEON eddy covariance Level 0 prime (L0’) data files contain eddy covariance turbulent exchange (ECTE) and eddy covariance storage exchange (ECSE) data, in HDF5 format, at the original sensor sampling frequency (e.g., 20 Hz for 3D wind, 40Hz for accelerometer measurements, 1 Hz for CO2/H2O concentration profile measurements). These are the input data which are processed by the eddy4R code to obtain standard L1-4 data products. Additional metadata about the sensor and data, a description of terms, as well as readme info about the HDF5 file are also included. These files are available via an [alternative download method](http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/documents/EC_L0P_Download_Inst_20181119) utilizing the cURL command line tool or a Python script that is provided with the download instructions. Check the Data Availability Chart before attempting to download L0’ data as these files are only available for months that have already been published on the Data Portal. Please let us know in the ‘contact us’ form if there are any problems downloading the files, and indicate Assignment group: TIS Science Support for fastest routing.  

During nominal operations, we plan to produce and publish the data products in three phases, to accommodate a variety of use cases: the initial near-real-time transition, a science reviewed quality transition, and the epoch yearly transition. The initial near-real-time transition is scheduled to process daily expanded files at a 5-day delay after data collection to accommodate a 9-day centered planar-fit window. If the data has not been received from the field it will attempt to process daily for 30 days, and if not all data is available after this window a force execution is performed populating a HDF5 file with metadata and filling data with NaN’s. The monthly basic file will be produced after all daily files are available, as early as 5 days after the end of the month, and no later than 30 days after the last daily file was initially attempted to be processed. Daily basic files are not produced. After the initial transition, the NEON science team has a one month window to manually flag data that were identified as suspect through field-based problem tracking and resolution tickets or through additional manual data quality analysis. Then, the science-reviewed transition will occur, and the data will be republished to the data portal. The last transition type is part of the yearly epoch versioning, which provides a fully quality assured and quality controlled version of the data using the latest full release of the processing code. This transition is scheduled to occur 18 months after the initial data collection. For additional details please see [NEON.DOC.004571](http://data.neonscience.org/documents).

NEON DATA POLICY AND CITATION GUIDELINES

Please visit http://data.neonscience.org/data-policy for more information about NEON's data policy and citation guidelines.

DATA QUALITY AND VERSIONING
---------------------------

The data contained in this file are considered provisional. Updates to the data, QA/QC and/or processing algorithms over time will occur on an as-needed basis.  Please check back to this site for updates tracked in change logs.  Query reproducibility on provisional data cannot be guaranteed. 
 
Starting in 2020 or earlier, NEON will begin to offer static versions of each data product, annotated with a globally unique identifier. Versioned IS and OS data will be produced by reprocessing each IS and OS data product from the beginning of the data collection period to approximately 12-18 months prior to the reprocessing date (to allow for calibration checks, return of external lab data, etc.). The reprocessing step will use the most recent QA/QC methods and processing algorithms. Versioned AOP data will be produced by reprocessing the entire AOP archive as advances in algorithms and processing technology are incorporated. This will typically occur in the northern winter months, between flight season peaks, and will be on the order of every 3 to 5 years in frequency.
