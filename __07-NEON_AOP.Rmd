## About Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data

The electromagnetic spectrum is composed of thousands of bands representing 
different types of light energy. Imaging spectrometers (instruments that collect 
hyperspectral data) break the electromagnetic spectrum into groups of bands 
that support classification of objects by their spectral properties on the 
earth's surface. Hyperspectral data consists of many bands -- up to hundreds of 
bands -- that cover the electromagnetic spectrum.

The NEON imaging spectrometer collects data within the 380nm to 2510nm portions 
of the electromagnetic spectrum within bands that are approximately 5nm in 
width. This results in a hyperspectral data cube that contains approximately 
426 bands - which means big, big data.

## Key Metadata for Hyperspectral Data

### Bands and Wavelengths

A *band* represents a group of wavelengths. For example, the wavelength values 
between 695nm and 700nm might be one band as captured by an imaging spectrometer. 
The imaging spectrometer collects reflected light energy in a pixel for light 
in that band. Often when you work with a multi or hyperspectral dataset, the 
band information is reported as the center wavelength value. This value 
represents the center point value of the wavelengths represented in that band. 
Thus in a band spanning 695-700 nm, the center would be 697.5).

### Spectral Resolution
The spectral resolution of a dataset that has more than one band, refers to the 
width of each band in the dataset. In the example above, a band was defined as 
spanning 695-700nm. The width or spatial resolution of the band is thus 5 
nanometers. To see an example of this, check out the band widths for the 
<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-are-band-designations-landsat-satellites?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products" target="_blank">Landsat sensors</a>.

 
### Full Width Half Max (FWHM)
The full width half max (FWHM) will also often be reported in a multi or 
hyperspectral dataset. This value represents the spread of the band around that 
center point. 

<figure>
    <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/dev-aten/graphics/hyperspectral-general/FWHM2.png">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/dev-aten/graphics/hyperspectral-general/FWHM2.png"
    alt="Graphic showing an example of the Full Width Half Max value of a band. The full width half band value is determined by the relative distance in nanometers between the band center and the edge of the band.">
    </a>
    <figcaption>The Full Width Half Max (FWHM) of a band relates to the distance 
    in nanometers between the band center and the edge of the band. In this 
    case, the FWHM for Band C is 5 nm.</figcaption>
</figure>

In the illustration above, the band that covers 695-700nm has a FWHM of 5 nm. 
While a general spectral resolution of the sensor is often provided, not all 
sensors create bands of uniform widths. For instance bands 1-9 of Landsat 8 are 
listed below (Courtesy of <a href="http://landsat.usgs.gov" target="_blank">USGS</a>)


| Band | Wavelength range (microns) | Spatial Resolution (m) | Spectral Width (microns)|
|-------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| Band 1 - Coastal aerosol | 0.43 - 0.45 | 30 | 0.02 |
| Band 2 - Blue | 0.45 - 0.51 | 30 | 0.06 |
| Band 3 - Green | 0.53 - 0.59 | 30 | 0.06 |
| Band 4 - Red | 0.64 - 0.67 | 30 | 0.03 |
| Band 5 - Near Infrared (NIR) | 0.85 - 0.88 | 30 | 0.03 |
| Band 6 - SWIR 1 | 1.57 - 1.65 | 30 | 0.08  |
| Band 7 - SWIR 2 | 2.11 - 2.29 | 30 | 0.18 |
| Band 8 - Panchromatic | 0.50 - 0.68 | 15 | 0.18 |
| Band 9 - Cirrus | 1.36 - 1.38 | 30 | 0.02 |

**Remember** that the example dataset linked here only has 1 out of every 4 bands
included in a full NEON hyperspectral dataset (this substantially reduces the file 
size!). When we refer to bands in this tutorial, we will note the band numbers for 
this example dataset, which are different from NEON production data. To convert 
a band number (b) from this example data subset to the equivalent band in a full 
NEON hyperspectral file (b'), use the following equation: b' = 1+4*(b-1).

### Recommended Skills

For this tutorial, you should be comfortable reading data from a HDF5 file and 
have a general familiarity with hyperspectral data. If you aren't familiar with 
these steps already, we highly recommend you work through the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/hsi-hdf5-r" target="_blank"> 
*Introduction to Working with Hyperspectral Data in HDF5 Format in R* tutorial</a>
before moving on to this tutorial.

</div> 

Everything on our planet reflects electromagnetic radiation from the Sun, and 
different types of land cover often have dramatically different refelectance 
properties across the spectrum. One of the most powerful aspects of the NEON 
Imaging Spectrometer (a.k.a. NEON's hyperspectral imager) is that it can 
accurately measure these reflectance properties at a very high spectral resolution. 
When you plot the reflectance values across the observed spectrum, you will see 
that different land cover types (vegetation, pavement, bare soils, etc.) have 
distinct patterns in their reflectance values, a feature that we call the 
'spectral signature' of a particular land cover class. 

In this tutorial, we will extract a single pixel's worth of reflectance 
values to plot a spectral signature for that pixel. In order to plot the 
spectral signature for a given pixel in this hyperspectral dataset, we will 
need to extract the reflectance values for that pixel, and pair those with the 
wavelengths that are represented in those measurements. We will also need to 
adjust the reflectance values by the scaling factor that is saved as an 
'attribute' in the HDF5 file. First, let's start by defining the working 
directory and reading in the example dataset.

```{r call-libraries, results="hide" }

# Call required packages
library(rhdf5)
library(plyr)
library(ggplot2)

# set working directory to ensure R can find the file we wish to import and where
# we want to save our files. Be sure to move the download into your working directory!
wd <- "./data/" #This will depend on your local environment


```

Now, we need to access the H5 file.

```{r open-H5-file }

# Define the file name to be opened
f <- paste0(wd,"NEON_hyperspectral_tutorial_example_subset.h5")
# look at the HDF5 file structure 
h5ls(f,all=T) 

```


## Read Wavelength Values

Next, let's read in the wavelength center associated with each band in the HDF5 
file. We will later match these with the reflectance values and show both in 
our final spectral signature plot.

```{r read-band-wavelengths }

# read in the wavelength information from the HDF5 file
wavelengths <- h5read(f,"/SJER/Reflectance/Metadata/Spectral_Data/Wavelength")

```


## Extract Z-dimension data slice

Next, we will extract all reflectance values for one pixel. This makes up the 
spectral signature or profile of the pixel. To do that, we'll use the `h5read()` 
function. Here we pick an arbitrary pixel at `(100,35)`, and use the `NULL` 
value to select *all* bands from that location.

```{r extract-spectra }

# extract all bands from a single pixel
aPixel <- h5read(f,"/SJER/Reflectance/Reflectance_Data",index=list(NULL,100,35))

# The line above generates a vector of reflectance values.
# Next, we reshape the data and turn them into a dataframe
b <- adply(aPixel,c(1))

# create clean data frame
aPixeldf <- b[2]

# add wavelength data to matrix
aPixeldf$Wavelength <- wavelengths

head(aPixeldf)

```

## Scale Factor

Then, we can pull the spatial attributes that we'll need to adjust the reflectance 
values. Often, large raster data contain floating point (values with decimals) information.
However, floating point data consume more space (yield a larger file size) compared
to integer values. Thus, to keep the file sizes smaller, the data will be scaled
by a factor of 10, 100, 10000, etc. This `scale factor` will be noted in the data attributes.

```{r pull-scale-factor }

# grab scale factor from the Reflectance attributes
reflectanceAttr <- h5readAttributes(f,"/SJER/Reflectance/Reflectance_Data" )

scaleFact <- reflectanceAttr$Scale_Factor

# add scaled data column to DF
aPixeldf$scaled <- (aPixeldf$V1/as.vector(scaleFact))

# make nice column names
names(aPixeldf) <- c('Reflectance','Wavelength','ScaledReflectance')
head(aPixeldf)

```

## Plot Spectral Signature

Now we're ready to plot our spectral signature!

```{r plot-spectra, fig.width=9, fig.height=6, fig.cap="Spectral signature plot with wavelength in nanometers on the x-axis and reflectance on the y-axis."}

ggplot(data=aPixeldf)+
   geom_line(aes(x=Wavelength, y=ScaledReflectance))+
   xlab("Wavelength (nm)")+
   ylab("Reflectance")

```

## About Hyperspectral Data 
We often want to generate a 3 band image from multi or hyperspectral data. The 
most commonly recognized band combination is RGB which stands for Red, Green and 
Blue. RGB images are just like the images that your camera takes. But there are 
other band combinations that are useful too. For example, near infrared images 
emphasize vegetation and help us classify or identify where vegetation is located 
on the ground.

## Create a Raster Stack in R

In the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/hsi-hdf5-r" target="_blank">previous activity</a>, 
we exported a single band of the NEON Reflectance data from a HDF5 file. In this 
activity, we will create a full color image using 3 (red, green and blue - RGB) 
bands. We will follow many of the steps we followed in the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/hsi-hdf5-r" target="_blank">Intro to Working with Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data in HDF5 Format in R</a> tutorial. 
These steps included loading required packages, reading in our file and viewing 
the file structure.

```{r load-libraries}

# Load required packages
library(raster)
library(rhdf5)

# create path to file name
f <- paste0(wd,"NEON_hyperspectral_tutorial_example_subset.h5")

```

```{r view-file-structure, eval=FALSE, comment=NA}
# View HDF5 file structure 
View(h5ls(f,all=T))

```

To spatially locate our raster data, we need a few key attributes:

* The coordinate reference system
* The spatial extent of the raster
   
We'll begin by grabbing these key attributes from the H5 file.   

```{r get-spatial-attributes }

# define coordinate reference system from the EPSG code provided in the HDF5 file
myEPSG <- h5read(f,"/SJER/Reflectance/Metadata/Coordinate_System/EPSG Code" )
myCRS <- crs(paste0("+init=epsg:",myEPSG))

# get the Reflectance_Data attributes
reflInfo <- h5readAttributes(f,"/SJER/Reflectance/Reflectance_Data" )

# Grab the UTM coordinates of the spatial extent
xMin <- reflInfo$Spatial_Extent_meters[1]
xMax <- reflInfo$Spatial_Extent_meters[2]
yMin <- reflInfo$Spatial_Extent_meters[3]
yMax <- reflInfo$Spatial_Extent_meters[4]

# define the extent (left, right, top, bottom)
rasExt <- extent(xMin,xMax,yMin,yMax)

# view the extent to make sure that it looks right
rasExt

# Finally, define the no data value for later
myNoDataValue <- as.integer(reflInfo$Data_Ignore_Value)
myNoDataValue
```

Next, we'll write a function that will perform the processing that we did step by 
step in the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/hsi-hdf5-r" target="_blank">Intro to Working with Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data in HDF5 Format in R</a>.
This will allow us to process multiple bands in bulk.

The function `band2Rast` slices a band of data from the HDF5 file, and
extracts the reflectance. It then converts the data into a matrix, converts it to
a raster, and finally returns a spatially corrected raster for the specified band. 

The function requires the following variables:

* file: the file
* band: the band number we wish to extract
* noDataValue: the noDataValue for the raster
* extent: a raster `Extent` object .
* crs: the Coordinate Reference System for the raster

The function output is a spatially referenced, R raster object.

```{r function-read-refl-data }

# file: the hdf file
# band: the band you want to process
# returns: a matrix containing the reflectance data for the specific band

band2Raster <- function(file, band, noDataValue, extent, CRS){
    # first, read in the raster
    out <- h5read(file,"/SJER/Reflectance/Reflectance_Data",index=list(band,NULL,NULL))
	  # Convert from array to matrix
	  out <- (out[1,,])
	  # transpose data to fix flipped row and column order 
    # depending upon how your data are formatted you might not have to perform this
    # step.
	  out <- t(out)
    # assign data ignore values to NA
    # note, you might chose to assign values of 15000 to NA
    out[out == myNoDataValue] <- NA
	  
    # turn the out object into a raster
    outr <- raster(out,crs=CRS)
   
    # assign the extents to the raster
    extent(outr) <- extent
   
    # return the raster object
    return(outr)
}

```


Now that the function is created, we can create our list of rasters. The list 
specifies which bands (or dimensions in our hyperspectral dataset) we want to 
include in our raster stack. Let's start with a typical RGB (red, green, blue) 
combination. We will use bands 14, 9, and 4 (bands 58, 34, and 19 in a full 
NEON hyperspectral dataset).

<div id="ds-dataTip" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i>**Data Tip - wavelengths and bands:** Remember that 
you can look at the wavelengths dataset in the HDF5 file to determine the center 
wavelength value for each band. Keep in mind that this data subset only includes
every fourth band that is available in a full NEON hyperspectral dataset!
</div>


```{r create-raster-stack }

# create a list of the bands we want in our stack
rgb <- list(14,9,4) #list(58,34,19) when using full NEON hyperspectral dataset

# lapply tells R to apply the function to each element in the list
rgb_rast <- lapply(rgb,FUN=band2Raster, file = f,
                   noDataValue=myNoDataValue, 
                   extent=rasExt,
                   CRS=myCRS)

# check out the properties or rgb_rast
# note that it displays properties of 3 rasters.
rgb_rast

# finally, create a raster stack from our list of rasters
rgbStack <- stack(rgb_rast)

```

In the code chunk above, we used the `lapply()` function, which is a powerful,
flexible way to apply a function (in this case, our `band2Raster()` fucntion)
multiple times. You can <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/using-apply-sapply-lapply-in-r/" target="_blank">learn more about lapply() here</a>. 

NOTE: We are using the `raster stack` object in R to store several rasters that 
are of the same CRS and extent. This is a popular and convenient way to organize 
co-incident rasters.

Next, add the names of the bands to the raster so we can easily keep track of 
the bands in the list.

```{r plot-raster-stack, fig.cap="Raster plot of band 14 from the raster stack created. The x-axis and y-axis values represent the extent, which range from 257500 to 258000 meters easting, and 4112500 to 4113000 meters northing, respectively. The plot legend depicts the range of reflectance values, which go from 0 to 0.8."}

# Create a list of band names
bandNames <- paste("Band_",unlist(rgb),sep="")

# set the rasterStack's names equal to the list of bandNames created above
names(rgbStack) <- bandNames

# check properties of the raster list - note the band names
rgbStack

# scale the data as specified in the reflInfo$Scale Factor
rgbStack <- rgbStack/as.integer(reflInfo$Scale_Factor)

# plot one raster in the stack to make sure things look OK.
plot(rgbStack$Band_14, main="Band 14")

	
```

We can play with the color ramps too if we want:

```{r plot-HSI-raster, fig.cap=c("Raster plot of band 14 from the raster stack created using different colors available from the terrain.colors funtion. The x-axis and y-axis values represent the extent, which range from 257500 to 258000 meters easting, and 4112500 to 4113000 meters northing, respectively.","Raster plot of band 14 from the raster stack created with a 0.5 adjustment of the z plane, which causes the image to be stretched. The x-axis and y-axis values represent the extent, which range from 257500 to 25800 meters easting, and 4112500 to 4113000 meters northing, respectively. The plot legend depicts the range of reflectance values, which go from 0 to 0.8.","Raster plot of band 14 from the raster stack created using a different color palette. The x-axis and y-axis values represent the extent, which range from 257500 to 258000 meters easting, and 4112500 to 4113000 meters northing, respectively.")}

# change the colors of our raster 
myCol <- terrain.colors(25)
image(rgbStack$Band_14, main="Band 14", col=myCol)

# adjust the zlims or the stretch of the image
myCol <- terrain.colors(25)
image(rgbStack$Band_14, main="Band 14", col=myCol, zlim = c(0,.5))

# try a different color palette
myCol <- topo.colors(15, alpha = 1)
image(rgbStack$Band_14, main="Band 14", col=myCol, zlim=c(0,.5))

```


The `plotRGB` function allows you to combine three bands to create an image. 


```{r plot-RGB-Image, fig.cap="RGB image of a portion of the SJER field site using 3 bands fom the raster stack. Brightness values have been stretched using the stretch argument to produce a natural looking image."}
# create a 3 band RGB image
plotRGB(rgbStack,
        r=1,g=2,b=3,
        stretch = "lin")

```

<i class="fa fa-star"></i>**A note about image stretching:** Notice that we use the argument
`stretch="lin"` in this plotting function, which automatically stretches the 
brightness values for us to produce a natural-looking image.


Once you've created your raster, you can export it as a GeoTIFF. You can bring 
this GeoTIFF into any GIS program!

```{r save-raster-geotiff, eval=FALSE, comment=NA}

# write out final raster	
# note: if you set overwrite to TRUE, then you will overwite or lose the older
# version of the tif file! Keep this in mind.
writeRaster(rgbStack, file=paste0(wd,"NEON_hyperspectral_tutorial_example_RGB_stack_image.tif"), format="GTiff", overwrite=TRUE)

```

**Remember** that the example dataset linked here only has 1 out of every 4 bands
included in a full NEON hyperspectral dataset (this substantially reduces the file 
size!). When we refer to bands in this tutorial, we will note the band numbers for 
this example dataset, which are different from NEON production data. To convert 
a band number (b) from this example data subset to the equivalent band in a full 
NEON hyperspectral file (b'), use the following equation: b' = 1+4*(b-1).

### Recommended Skills

This tutorial will require that you be comfortable navigating HDF5 files, 
and have an understanding of what spectral signatures are. For additional 
information on these topics, we highly recommend you work through the 
<a href="https://neonscience.org/intro-hsi-r-series" target="_blank"> *Introduction to Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data* series</a>
before moving on to this tutorial.

</div>


## Getting Started

First, we need to load our required packages, and import the hyperspectral
data (in HDF5 format). We will also collect a few other important pieces of 
information (band wavelengths and scaling factor) while we're at it.

```{r load-libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Load required packages
library(rhdf5)
library(reshape2)
library(raster)
library(ggplot2)

# set working directory to ensure R can find the file we wish to import and where
# we want to save our files. Be sure to move the download into your working directory!


# define filepath to the hyperspectral dataset
f <- paste0(wd,"NEON_hyperspectral_tutorial_example_subset.h5")

# read in the wavelength information from the HDF5 file
wavelengths <- h5read(f,"/SJER/Reflectance/Metadata/Spectral_Data/Wavelength")

# grab scale factor from the Reflectance attributes
reflInfo <- h5readAttributes(f,"/SJER/Reflectance/Reflectance_Data" )

scaleFact <- reflInfo$Scale_Factor

```

Now, we read in the RGB image that we created in an earlier tutorial and plot it. 
If you didn't make this image before, you can download it from the link at the top 
of this page.

```{r read-in-RGB-and-plot, fig.cap="RGB image of a portion of the SJER field site using 3 bands from the raster stack. Brightness values have been stretched using the stretch argument to produce a natural looking image. At the top right of the image, there is dark, brakish water. Scattered throughout the image, there are several trees. At the center of the image, there is a baseball field, with low grass. At the bottom left of the image, there is a parking lot and some buildings with highly reflective surfaces, and adjacent to it is a section of a gravel lot."}

# Read in RGB image as a 'stack' rather than a plain 'raster'
rgbStack <- stack(paste0(wd,"NEON_hyperspectral_tutorial_example_RGB_stack_image.tif"))

# Plot as RGB image
plotRGB(rgbStack,
        r=1,g=2,b=3, scale=300, 
        stretch = "lin")

```

## Interactive `click` Function from `raster` Package

Next, we use an interactive clicking function to identify the pixels that we want
to extract spectral signatures for. To follow along best with this tutorial, we 
suggest the following five cover types (exact location shown below). 

1. Irrigated grass
2. Tree canopy (avoid the shaded northwestern side of the tree)
3. Roof
4. Bare soil (baseball diamond infield)
5. Open water

As shown here:
<figure >
    <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/dev-aten/graphics/hyperspectral-general/Click_points.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/dev-aten/graphics/hyperspectral-general/Click_points.png"
    alt="RGB image of a portion of the SJER field site using 3 bands fom the raster stack. Also displayed are points labeled with numbers one through five, representing five cover types selected using the interactive click function from the raster package. At the top right of the image, the dark, brakish water has been selected as point 5. The tops of a cluster of trees on the top left of the image has been selected as point 2. At the center of the image, the baseball field with low grass has been selected as point 1. At the bottom left of the image the top of a building has been selected as point 3, and the adjacent gravel lot has been selected as point 4. Plotting parameters have been changed to enhance visibility.">
    </a>
<figcaption> Five different land cover types chosen for this study (magenta dots) in the order listed above (red numbers).</figcaption>
</figure>


```{r click-to-select, eval=FALSE, comment=NA}

# change plotting parameters to better see the points and numbers generated from clicking
par(col="red", cex=3)

# use the 'click' function
c <- click(rgbStack, id=T, xy=T, cell=T, type="p", pch=16, col="magenta", col.lab="red")

```

Once you have clicked your five points, press the `ESC` key to save your
clicked points and close the function before moving on to the next step. If 
you make a mistake in the step, run the `plotRGB()` function again to start over.
```{r create-c-hidden, include=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
c <- as.data.frame(c(135750,50101,234644,242062,73477))
names(c) <- "cell"
```

The `click()` function identifies the cell number that you clicked, but in order 
to extract spectral signatures, we need to convert that cell number into a row
and column, as shown here:

```{r convert-cell-to-row-column}
# convert raster cell number into row and column (used to extract spectral signature below)
c$row <- c$cell%/%nrow(rgbStack)+1 # add 1 because R is 1-indexed
c$col <- c$cell%%ncol(rgbStack)
```

## Extract Spectral Signatures from HDF5 file
Next, we loop through each of the cells that we selected to use the `h5read()` 
function to etract the reflectance values of all bands from the given row and
column. 

```{r extract-spectral-signaures}

# create a new dataframe from the band wavelengths so that we can add
# the reflectance values for each cover type
Pixel_df <- as.data.frame(wavelengths)

# loop through each of the cells that we selected
for(i in 1:length(c$cell)){
# extract Spectra from a single pixel
aPixel <- h5read(f,"/SJER/Reflectance/Reflectance_Data",
                 index=list(NULL,c$col[i],c$row[i]))

# scale reflectance values from 0-1
aPixel <- aPixel/as.vector(scaleFact)

# reshape the data and turn into dataframe
b <- adply(aPixel,c(1))

# rename the column that we just created
names(b)[2] <- paste0("Point_",i)

# add reflectance values for this pixel to our combined data.frame called Pixel_df
Pixel_df <- cbind(Pixel_df,b[2])
}

```

## Plot Spectral signatures using ggplot2
Finally, we have everything that we need to plot the spectral signatures for 
each of the pixels that we clicked. In order to color our lines by the different
land cover types, we will first reshape our data using the `melt()` function, then
plot the spectral signatures.

```{r plot-spectral-signatures, fig.width=9, fig.height=6, fig.cap="Plot of spectral signatures for the five different land cover types: Field, Tree, Roof, Soil, and Water. On the x-axis is wavelength in nanometers and on the y-axis is reflectance values."}
# Use the melt() funciton to reshape the dataframe into a format that ggplot prefers
Pixel.melt <- melt(Pixel_df, id.vars = "wavelengths", value.name = "Reflectance")

# Now, let's plot some spectral signatures!
ggplot()+
  geom_line(data = Pixel.melt, mapping = aes(x=wavelengths, y=Reflectance, color=variable), lwd=1.5)+
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("green2", "green4", "grey50","tan4","blue3"),
                      labels = c("Field", "Tree", "Roof","Soil","Water"))+
  labs(color = "Cover Type")+
  ggtitle("Land cover spectral signatures")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size=20))+
  xlab("Wavelength")
```

Nice! However, there seems to be something weird going on in the wavelengths 
near 1400nm and 1850 nm...

## Atmospheric Absorbtion Bands 
Those irregularities around 1400nm and 1850 nm are two major atmospheric 
absorbtion bands - regions where gasses in the atmosphere (primarily carbon 
dioxide and water vapor) absorb radiation, and therefore, obscure the 
reflected radiation that the imaging spectrometer measures. Fortunately, the 
lower and upper bound of each of those atmopheric absopbtion bands is specified 
in the HDF5 file. Let's read those bands and plot rectangles where the 
reflectance measurements are obscured by atmospheric absorbtion. 

```{r mask-atmospheric-absorbtion-bands, fig.width=9, fig.height=6, fig.cap="Plot of spectral signatures for the five different land cover types: Field, Tree, Roof, Soil, and Water. Added to the plot are two rectangles in regions near 1400nm and 1850nm where the reflectance measurements are obscured by atmospheric absorption. On the x-axis is wavelength in nanometers and on the y-axis is reflectance values."}

# grab Reflectance metadata (which contains absorption band limits)
reflMetadata <- h5readAttributes(f,"/SJER/Reflectance" )

ab1 <- reflMetadata$Band_Window_1_Nanometers
ab2 <- reflMetadata$Band_Window_2_Nanometers

# Plot spectral signatures again with rectangles showing the absorption bands
ggplot()+
  geom_line(data = Pixel.melt, mapping = aes(x=wavelengths, y=Reflectance, color=variable), lwd=1.5)+
  geom_rect(mapping=aes(ymin=min(Pixel.melt$Reflectance),ymax=max(Pixel.melt$Reflectance), xmin=ab1[1], xmax=ab1[2]), color="black", fill="grey40", alpha=0.8)+
  geom_rect(mapping=aes(ymin=min(Pixel.melt$Reflectance),ymax=max(Pixel.melt$Reflectance), xmin=ab2[1], xmax=ab2[2]), color="black", fill="grey40", alpha=0.8)+
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("green2", "green4", "grey50","tan4","blue3"),
                      labels = c("Field", "Tree", "Roof","Soil","Water"))+
  labs(color = "Cover Type")+
  ggtitle("Land cover spectral signatures")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size=20))+
  xlab("Wavelength")
```

Now we can clearly see that the noisy sections of each spectral signature are 
within the atmospheric absorbtion bands. For our final step, let's take all 
reflectance values from within each absorbtion band and set them to `NA` to 
remove the noisy sections from the plot.

```{r remove-absorbtion-band-reflectances, fig.width=9, fig.height=6, fig.cap="Plot of spectral signatures for the five different land cover types: Field, Tree, Roof, Soil, and Water. Values falling within the two rectangles from the previous image have been set to NA and ommited from the plot. On the x-axis is wavelength in nanometers and on the y-axis is reflectance values."}

# Duplicate the spectral signatures into a new data.frame
Pixel.melt.masked <- Pixel.melt

# Mask out all values within each of the two atmospheric absorbtion bands
Pixel.melt.masked[Pixel.melt.masked$wavelengths>ab1[1]&Pixel.melt.masked$wavelengths<ab1[2],]$Reflectance <- NA
Pixel.melt.masked[Pixel.melt.masked$wavelengths>ab2[1]&Pixel.melt.masked$wavelengths<ab2[2],]$Reflectance <- NA

# Plot the masked spectral signatures
ggplot()+
  geom_line(data = Pixel.melt.masked, mapping = aes(x=wavelengths, y=Reflectance, color=variable), lwd=1.5)+
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("green2", "green4", "grey50","tan4","blue3"),
                      labels = c("Field", "Tree", "Roof", "Soil", "Water"))+
  labs(color = "Cover Type")+
  ggtitle("Land cover spectral signatures")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size=20))+
  xlab("Wavelength")

```

There you have it, spectral signatures for five different land cover types, 
with the readings from the atmospheric absorbtion bands removed.

## Written Questions: Compare Spectral Signatures

There are many interesting comparisons to make with spectral signatures. 
Try these challenges to explore hyperspectral data further:

1. Compare five different types of vegetation, and pick an appropriate color
for each of their lines. A nice guide to the many different color options
in R can be found <a href="http://sape.inf.usi.ch/quick-reference/ggplot2/colour" target="_blank"> *here*.</a>

2. What happens if you only click four points? What about six? How does this
change the spectral signature plots, and can you fix any errors that occur?

3. Does shallow water have a different spectral signature than deep water?

And Ranging (LiDAR) technology, specifically how discrete return lidar 
data are collected and represented in las/laz files. For more information 
on how lidar works, please see this

</div> 

## Introduction to Structural Diversity Metrics
Forest structure influences many important ecological processes, including 
biogeochemical cycling, wildfires, species richness and diversity, and many 
others. Quantifying forest structure, hereafter referred to as "structural 
diversity," presents a challenge for many reasons, including difficulty in 
measuring individual trees, limbs, and leaves across large areas. In order 
to overcome this challenge, today's researchers use Light Detection And 
Ranging (LiDAR) technology to measure large areas of forest. It is also 
challenging to calculate meaningful summary metrics of a forest's structure 
that 1) are ecologically relevant and 2) can be used to compare different 
forested locations. In this tutorial, you will be introduced to a few tools 
that will help you to explore and quantify forest structure using LiDAR data 
collected at two field sites of the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/" target="_blank"> 
National Ecological Observatory Network</a>. 

## NEON AOP Discrete Return LIDAR
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/airborne-remote-sensing" target="_blank"> The NEON Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) </a>. 
has several sensors including discrete-return LiDAR, which is useful for measuring forest structural diversity that can be summarized into four categories of metrics: (1) canopy height, (2) canopy cover and openness, and (3) canopy heterogeneity (internal and external), and (4) vegetation area.

We will be comparing the structural diversity of two NEON sites that vary in their structural characteristics. 

First, we will look at <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/HARV" target="_blank">Harvard Forest (HARV)</a>, which is located in Massachusetts. It is a lower elevation, mixed deciduous and evergreen forest dominated by Quercus rubra, Acer rubrum, and Aralia nudicaulis.

Second, we will look at <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/TEAK" target="_blank">Lower Teakettle (TEAK)</a>, which is a high elevation forested NEON site in California. TEAK is an evergreen forest dominated by Abies magnifica, Abies concolor, Pinus jeffreyi, and Pinus contorta. 

As you can imagine, these two forest types will have both similarities and differences in their structural attributes. We can quantify these attributes by calculating several different structural diversity metrics, and comparing 
the results.

## Loading the LIDAR Products
To begin, we first need to load our required R packages, and set our working 
directory to the location where we saved the input LiDAR .laz files that can be 
downloaded from the NEON Data Portal.

```{r call-libraries, results="hide"}


library(lidR)
library(gstat)

############### Set working directory ######
#set the working of the downloaded tutorial folder
wd <- "./data/" #This will depend on your local machine
setwd(wd)

```

Next, we will read in the LiDAR data using the `lidR::readLAS()` function. 
Note that this function can read in both `.las` and `.laz` file formats.

```{r read-in-lidar-data}

############ Read in LiDAR data ###########
#2017 1 km2 tile .laz file type for HARV and TEAK

#Watch out for outlier Z points - this function also allows for the
#ability to filter outlier points well above or below the landscape
#(-drop_z_blow and -drop_z_above). See how we have done this here 
#for you.

HARV <- readLAS(paste0(wd,"NEON_D01_HARV_DP1_727000_4702000_classified_point_cloud_colorized.laz"),
                filter = "-drop_z_below 150 -drop_z_above 325")

TEAK <- readLAS(paste0(wd,"NEON_D17_TEAK_DP1_316000_4091000_classified_point_cloud_colorized.laz"),
                filter = "-drop_z_below 1694 -drop_z_above 2500")


```

## Normalizing Tree Height to Ground
To begin, we will take a look at the structural diversity of the dense mixed deciduous/evergreen 
forest of HARV. We're going to choose a 40 x 40 m spatial extent for our analysis, but first we 
need to normalize the height values of this LiDAR point cloud from an absolute elevation 
above mean sea level to height above the ground using the `lidR::lasnormalize()` function. This 
function relies on spatial interpolation, and therefore we want to perform this step on an area 
that is quite a bit larger than our area of interest to avoid edge effects. To be safe, we will 
clip out an area of 200 x 200 m, normalize it, and then clip out our smaller area of interest.

```{r correct-for-elevation}

############## Correct for elevation #####
#We're going to choose a 40 x 40 m spatial extent, which is the
#extent for NEON base plots. 
#First set the center of where you want the plot to be (note easting 
#and northing works in units of m because these data are in a UTM 
#proejction as shown in the summary above).
x <- 727500 #easting 
y <- 4702500 #northing

#Cut out a 200 x 200 m buffer by adding 100 m to easting and 
#northing coordinates (x,y).
data.200m <- 
   lasclipRectangle(HARV,
                    xleft = (x - 100), ybottom = (y - 100),
                    xright = (x + 100), ytop = (y + 100))

#Correct for ground height using a kriging function to interpolate 
#elevation from ground points in the .laz file.
#If the function will not run, then you may need to checkfor outliers
#by adjusting the 'drop_z_' arguments when reading in the .laz files.
dtm <- grid_terrain(data.200m, 1, kriging(k = 10L))
data.200m <- lasnormalize(data.200m, dtm)

#Will often give a warning if not all points could be corrected, 
#but visually check to see if it corrected for ground height. 
plot(data.200m)
#There's only a few uncorrected points and we'll fix these in 
#the next step. 

#Clip 20 m out from each side of the easting and northing 
#coordinates (x,y).
data.40m <- 
   lasclipRectangle(data.200m, 
                    xleft = (x - 20), ybottom = (y - 20),
                    xright = (x + 20), ytop = (y + 20))

data.40m@data$Z[data.40m@data$Z <= .5] <- NA  
#This line filters out all z_vals below .5 m as we are less 
#interested in shrubs/trees. 
#You could change it to zero or another height depending on interests.

## Calculating Structural Diversity Metrics
Now that we have our area of interest normalized and clipped, we can proceed with calculating 
our structural diversity metrics. 

```{r calculate-structural-diversity-metrics, fig.cap="Canopy Height Model (CHM) of HARV study area"}

############# Structural diversity metrics  ######

#GENERATE CANOPY HEIGHT MODEL (CHM) (i.e. a 1 m2 raster grid of 
#vegetations heights)
#res argument specifies pixel size in meters and dsmtin is 
#for raster interpolation
chm <- grid_canopy(data.40m, res = 1, dsmtin())  

#visualize CHM
plot(chm) 

#MEAN OUTER CANOPY HEIGHT (MOCH)
#calculate MOCH, the mean CHM height value
mean.max.canopy.ht <- mean(chm@data@values, na.rm = TRUE) 

#MAX CANOPY HEIGHT
#calculate HMAX, the maximum CHM height value
max.canopy.ht <- max(chm@data@values, na.rm=TRUE) 

#RUMPLE
#calculate rumple, a ratio of outer canopy surface area to 
#ground surface area (1600 m^2)
rumple <- rumple_index(chm) 

#TOP RUGOSITY
#top rugosity, the standard deviation of pixel values in chm and 
#is a measure of outer canopy roughness
top.rugosity <- sd(chm@data@values, na.rm = TRUE) 

#DEEP GAPS & DEEP GAP FRACTION
#number of cells in raster (also area in m2)
cells <- length(chm@data@values) 
chm.0 <- chm
chm.0[is.na(chm.0)] <- 0 #replace NAs with zeros in CHM
#create variable for the number of deep gaps, 1 m^2 canopy gaps
zeros <- which(chm.0@data@values == 0) 
deepgaps <- length(zeros) #number of deep gaps
#deep gap fraction, the number of deep gaps in the chm relative 
#to total number of chm pixels
deepgap.fraction <- deepgaps/cells 

#COVER FRACTION
#cover fraction, the inverse of deep gap fraction
cover.fraction <- 1 - deepgap.fraction 

#HEIGHT SD
#height SD, the standard deviation of height values for all points
#in the plot point cloud
vert.sd <- lasmetrics(data.40m, sd(Z, na.rm = TRUE)) 

#SD of VERTICAL SD of HEIGHT
#rasterize plot point cloud and calculate the standard deviation 
#of height values at a resolution of 1 m^2
sd.1m2 <- grid_metrics(data.40m, sd(Z), 1)
#standard deviation of the calculated standard deviations 
#from previous line 
#This is a measure of internal and external canopy complexity
sd.sd <- sd(sd.1m2[,3], na.rm = TRUE) 
 

#some of the next few functions won't handle NAs, so we need 
#to filter these out of a vector of Z points
Zs <- data.40m@data$Z
Zs <- Zs[!is.na(Zs)]

#ENTROPY 
#entropy, quantifies diversity & evenness of point cloud heights 
#by = 1 partitions point cloud in 1 m tall horizontal slices 
#ranges from 0-1, with 1 being more evenly distributed points 
#across the 1 m tall slices 
entro <- entropy(Zs, by = 1) 

#GAP FRACTION PROFILE 
#gap fraction profile, assesses the distribution of gaps in the 
#canopy volume 
#dz = 1 partitions point cloud in 1 m horizontal slices 
#z0 is set to a reasonable height based on the age and height of 
#the study sites 
gap_frac <- gap_fraction_profile(Zs, dz = 1, z0=3) 
#defines gap fraction profile as the average gap fraction in each 
#1 m horizontal slice assessed in the previous line
GFP.AOP <- mean(gap_frac$gf) 

#VAI
#leaf area density, assesses leaf area in the canopy volume 
#k = 0.5 is a standard extinction coefficient for foliage 
#dz = 1 partitions point cloud in 1 m horizontal slices 
#z0 is set to the same height as gap fraction profile above
LADen<-LAD(Zs, dz = 1, k=0.5, z0=3) 
#vegetation area index, sum of leaf area density values for 
#all horizontal slices assessed in previous line
VAI.AOP <- sum(LADen$lad, na.rm=TRUE) 

#VCI
#vertical complexity index, fixed normalization of entropy 
#metric calculated above
#set zmax comofortably above maximum canopy height
#by = 1 assesses the metric based on 1 m horizontal slices in 
#the canopy
VCI.AOP <- VCI(Zs, by = 1, zmax=100) 
```

We now have 13 metrics of structural diversity, which we can arrange into a single table:

```{r output-HARV-metrics}
#OUTPUT CALCULATED METRICS INTO A TABLE
#creates a dataframe row, out.plot, containing plot descriptors 
#and calculated metrics
HARV_structural_diversity <- 
   data.frame(matrix(c(x, y, mean.max.canopy.ht, max.canopy.ht, 
                       rumple, deepgaps,deepgap.fraction,
                       cover.fraction,top.rugosity, vert.sd, 
                       sd.sd, entro,GFP.AOP, VAI.AOP, VCI.AOP),
                     ncol = 15)) 

#provide descriptive names for the calculated metrics
colnames(HARV_structural_diversity) <- 
   c("easting", "northing", "mean.max.canopy.ht.aop",
     "max.canopy.ht.aop", "rumple.aop", "deepgaps.aop",
     "deepgap.fraction.aop","cover.fraction.aop", 
     "top.rugosity.aop", "vert.sd.aop", "sd.sd.aop", 
     "entropy.aop", "GFP.AOP.aop", "VAI.AOP.aop", "VCI.AOP.aop") 

#View the results
HARV_structural_diversity 

```

## Combining Everything Into One Function
Now that we have run through how to measure each structural diversity metric, let's create a 
convenient function to run these a little faster on the TEAK site for a comparison of structural 
diversity with HARV. 

```{r calculate-structural-diversity-metrics-TEAK}
#Let's correct for elevation and measure structural diversity for TEAK
x <- 316400 
y <- 4091700

data.200m <- lasclipRectangle(TEAK, 
                              xleft = (x - 100), ybottom = (y - 100),
                              xright = (x + 100), ytop = (y + 100))

dtm <- grid_terrain(data.200m, 1, kriging(k = 10L))
data.200m <- lasnormalize(data.200m, dtm)

data.40m <- lasclipRectangle(data.200m, 
                             xleft = (x - 20), ybottom = (y - 20),
                             xright = (x + 20), ytop = (y + 20))
data.40m@data$Z[data.40m@data$Z <= .5] <- 0  
plot(data.40m)
```

## Comparing Metrics Between Forests
How does the structural diversity of the evergreen TEAK forest compare to the mixed deciduous/evergreen forest from HARV? Let's combine the result data.frames for a direct comparison:

```{r combine results}

combined_results=rbind(HARV_structural_diversity, 
                       TEAK_structural_diversity)

# Add row names for clarity
row.names(combined_results)=c("HARV","TEAK")

# Take a look to compare
combined_results

```
